My two brothers-in-law and myself are all avid data professionals and we love two golf. We decided to create our own golf league where we track our data in a Google Sheets file. As the years have gone on, that Google sheets file became clutered and could not smoothly
handle the complex calculations we wanted to track. I decided to develop a simple Power BI dashboard that not only allows us to observe the statistics and insights that we are interested in, but also automate our entire data entry process.


Tools used:
Microsoft Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Relationship Management)
Microsoft Excel

Key Insights:

- Average Scores: These insights are showing what each may player may score any given round of 18 holes. The front and back 9 averages can tell which side each player tends to play better (if the front is better, maybe a short break is needed before starting the back.
If the back is better, it may indicate that more time spent warming up is needed.)

- Standard Deviations: These are great insights because they dive deeper into detail than just the average score. From the mean value, or the "average score", this can show a range of scores for each player that would be considered "expected" or "unexpected."

- Scatter Plots: This visual shows a linear regression of the rounds played by each player and their respective scores. The time sequence creates a trend line to show if each player is progressing or regressing. This is a vital piece of information because the average score may be a 95, but within the last x number of rounds, the scores may have been enough to move the line of best fit up. While the average score is a 95, you may not want to predict you will shoot a 95 that round given the recent trend.

- Par Type Averages: This is an interesting data point to observe as it gives you ballpark idea of what score each player will get on either a par 3, par 4, or par 5.

- Putts Per Round: This shows the average numbe of putts each player will take per round. It can also let you know how may putts per hole they average.
